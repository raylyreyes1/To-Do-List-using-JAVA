Making a  To-Do List Application using JAVA
A to-do list is a practical project that can be used in your daily life. In this project, you'll create an application where users can add tasks to do and mark them as completed when done. This project will introduce you to concepts like arrays, loops, and data structures such as lists.

Some potential features you can include in your to-do list app are:

Adding deadlines or due dates for each task
Categorizing tasks into different sections (e.g., work, personal, school)
Setting reminders for upcoming tasks
